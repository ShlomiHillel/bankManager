# simple MERN - full-stack

## Introduction

.

### Development mode

In the development mode, we will have 2 servers running. The front end code will be served by the [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) which helps with hot and live reloading. The server side Express code will be served by a node server using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) which helps in automatically restarting the server whenever server side code changes.

### Production mode

In the production mode, we will have only 1 server running. All the client side code will be bundled into static files using webpack and it will be served by the Node.js/Express application.

## Quick Start


## Documentation

### Folder Structure

All the source code will be inside **src** directory. Inside src, there is client and server directory. All the frontend code (react, css, js and any other assets) will be in client directory. Backend Node.js/Express code will be in the server directory.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser.

[webpack.config.js](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) file is used to describe the configurations required for webpack. Below is the webpack.config.js file which I am using.

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");
const CleanWebpackPlugin = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

const outputDirectory = "dist";

module.exports = {
  entry: ["babel-polyfill", "./src/client/index.js"],
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, outputDirectory),
    filename: "bundle.js"
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader"
        }
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"]
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|woff|woff2|eot|ttf|svg)$/,
        loader: "url-loader?limit=100000"
      }
    ]
  },
  devServer: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true,
    proxy: {
      "/api": "http://localhost:8080"
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    new CleanWebpackPlugin([outputDirectory]),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./public/index.html",
      favicon: "./public/favicon.ico"
    })
  ]
};
```

1.  **entry:** entry:Â ./src/client/index.js is where the application starts executing and webpack starts bundling.
    Note: babel-polyfill is added to support async/await. Read more [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill#usage-in-node-browserify-webpack).
2.  **output path and filename:** the target directory and the filename for the bundled output
3.  **module loaders:** Module loaders are transformations that are applied on the source code of a module. We pass all the js file through [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) to transform JSX to Javascript. CSS files are passed through [css-loaders](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and [style-loaders](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to load and bundle CSS files. Fonts and images are loaded through url-loader.
4.  **Dev Server:** Configurations for the webpack-dev-server which will be described in coming section.
5.  **plugins:** [clean-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin) is a webpack plugin to remove the build folder(s) before building. [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. It loads the template (public/index.html) and injects the output bundle.

### Webpack dev server

### Nodemon

Nodemon is a utility that will monitor for any changes in the server source code and it automatically restart the server. This is used in development only.

nodemon.json file is used to describe the configurations for Nodemon. Below is the nodemon.json file which I am using.

### Express

Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It is used to build our backend API's.

src/server/index.js is the entry point to the server application. Below is the src/server/index.js file

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const os = require("os");

const app = express();

app.use(express.static("dist"));
app.get("/api/getUsername", (req, res) =>
  res.send({ username: os.userInfo().username })
);
app.listen(8080, () => console.log("Listening on port 8080!"));
```

This starts a server and listens on port 8080 for connections. The app responds with `{username: <username>}` for requests to the URL (/api/getUsername). It is also configured to serve the static files from **dist** directory.

### Concurrently

[Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) is used to run multiple commands concurrently. I am using it to run the webpack dev server and the backend node server concurrently in the development environment. Below are the npm/yarn script commands used.

```javascript
"client": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --devtool inline-source-map --hot",
"server": "nodemon src/server/index.js",
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
```

### VSCode + ESLint + Prettier

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) takes care of the code-quality. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) takes care of all the formatting.

#### Installation guide

1.  Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  Install [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
3.  Install [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
4.  Modify the VSCode user settings to add below configuration

    ```javascript
    "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true,
    "eslint.autoFixOnSave": true,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "prettier.eslintIntegration": true
    ```

Above, we have modified editor configurations. Alternatively, this can be configured at the project level by following [this article](https://medium.com/@netczuk/your-last-eslint-config-9e35bace2f99).
